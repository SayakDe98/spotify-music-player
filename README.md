# Getting Started with Spotify Music Player

Spotify Music Player is a React App(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which makes use of the audio element in HTML5 which allows browsers to play your favourite songs. You can select various songs and play or pause them. You can
also click on seek or unseek buttons to seek or unseek the current song. A progress bar will show how long the current
song is played. You can also toggle between For You and Top Tracks. Select For You for all the songs recommended to you.
Select Top Tracks if you want to listen to the current top tracks. Have fun!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
